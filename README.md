# PixelHealer
PixelHealer can help you try to fix dead pixels by yourself, before running back to the store! You can use it to fix dead, stuck or 
hot pixels on LCD or TFT screens, on desktop monitors, laptops or tablets.

PixelHealer uses the already tested concept that flashing
RGB colors over a dead or stuck pixel will revive it. All you have to do is run PixelHealer, cover the dead pixel with the colored
repair window, and click Start Flashing. Let the repair window run for a while, then check to see if the pixel has been fixed
or revived. And repeat the process if necessary. 

PixelHealer has an intuitive interface and it is very easy to use. Use the mouse or your finger to move or resize the repair window.
Open the intuitive Settings window to change the flashing colors, the flashing interval, or to automatically close the app after a
certain period of time.
